# LLM Hallucination Detection (From Scratch)

This project explores how to detect and reduce hallucinations in large language models
using simple, interpretable methods.

## Goals
- Build a baseline hallucination detector
- Analyze model uncertainty and inconsistency
- Extend toward retrieval-augmented generation

## Tech Stack
- Python
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Scikit-learn

## Status
🚧 In progress (baseline under development)
